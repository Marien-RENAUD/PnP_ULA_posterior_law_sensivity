# PnP_ULA_posterior_law_sensivity

In the folder GMM_2D you will find the code use to generate the result for all the experiment shows in the dissertation.

In the folder pnp_ulu_images you will find the implementation use for the PnP-ULA algorithm for images. The Drunet neural network weights (too heavy to be put in github, can be ask if needed). A series of results can also be find in the folder pnp_ulu_images/results for each gray scale images and color images.
