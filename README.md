# PnP_ULA_posterior_law_sensivity

In the folder GMM_2D you will find the code use to generate results shows in the dissertation for 2D Gaussian Mixture Model.

In the folder pnp_ulu_images you will find the implementation used for the PnP-ULA on images. The Drunet neural network weights (too heavy to be put in github) can be ask to make the experiment reproduce if needed. A collection of results can be find in the folder pnp_ulu_images/results for gray scale images and color images.
